# Python Sales Data Analysis

This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world sales data using **Python** (Pandas). The task involved cleaning, merging, and transforming raw CSV files into a structured dataset ready for analysis.

### Tasks Completed:

- 📥 **Loaded** two raw sales CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
- 🔎 **Explored** the data (shape, data types, summary statistics, missing values).
- 🛠️ **Handled missing values**: Numeric columns were filled with mean/median, while text columns used forward/backward fill.
- 🔗 **Merged** datasets and removed duplicate Transaction IDs.
- 📊 **Filtered** transactions where SalesAmount > 1000 and selected key columns.
- 💾 **Exported** the cleaned dataset into `sales_cleaned.csv`.

### Outcomes:

- Delivered a fully cleaned dataset, free of missing values and duplicates.
- Improved data quality, making it ready for accurate reporting and analysis.
- Demonstrated ability to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations in Python.

### Skills Used:

* Python 🐍
* Pandas
* Data Cleaning & Transformation
* CSV Handling
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
