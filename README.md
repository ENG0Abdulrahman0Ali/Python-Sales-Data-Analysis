# 📈 Python Sales Data Analysis

### A Project Focused on Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Business Readiness using Pandas.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to handle and process real-world sales data using **Python** (specifically **Pandas**). The primary task involved applying end-to-end **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** operations to transform raw CSV files into a structured, high-quality dataset ready for in-depth analysis and reporting.

### 🔑 Key Contributions:

-   **Data Ingestion** 📥: Loaded two raw sales CSV files into **Pandas DataFrames** for processing.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔎: Performed initial data exploration to understand structure, identify data types, and determine the extent of missing values and outliers.
-   **Data Cleaning & Imputation** 🧺: Handled missing values by using mean/median imputation for numeric columns and forward/backward filling for text data.
-   **Data Integration** 🔗: Successfully **merged** the two datasets and ensured data integrity by removing duplicate Transaction IDs.
-   **Feature Engineering** 📊: Applied a business filter to select key transactions where SalesAmount > 1000 and isolated necessary columns for final analysis.
-   **Data Export** 💾: Delivered the finalized, cleaned dataset into a new file, **`sales_cleaned.csv`**, ready for subsequent BI tools.

### ✨ Project Outcomes & Value:

-   **Data Quality Assurance** ✅: Delivered a fully cleaned dataset, free of missing values and duplicates, ensuring accuracy for reporting.
-   **Demonstrated ETL Proficiency** ⚙️: Showcased the ability to perform robust Extract, Transform, Load (**ETL**) operations entirely within Python.
-   **Business Readiness** 💡: The processed data is instantly ready for advanced modeling and generating accurate business intelligence.
